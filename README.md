## Daily Mood Tracker

Daily Mood Tracker allows a person with depression, bipolar disorder, etc. easily select and change a mood score for the day.  Right now, there are options
to chart past moods over various time periods. In addition, the app stores onto the cloud, with the google firebase realtime database.

To Do:
* Adding more tracking variables (anxiety, anger?, split mania and depression into separate values?) 
* Gentle reminder to add a mood, in order to allow someone with very little energy to do a simple swipe
* Doctor's info? Download file?
* Implement privacy policy for placement on Google Play Store
*
